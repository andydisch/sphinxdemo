Introduction
============

We autogenerate documentation from source code.

Motivation
**********

We program in *python*, a high-level and general-purpose programming language.

Assuming we follow *docstring* conventions to document our python code.
A docstring is a string literal specified in source code that is used, like a comment, to document a specific segment of code. In python a docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the __doc__ special attribute of that object.

We can use *Sphinx*, a documentation generator written and used by the python community.

*Read the Docs* simplifies software documentation by automating building, versioning, and hosting of your docs for you.

By default, Sphinx converts reStructuredText files into HTML websites and other formats including PDF, EPub, Texinfo and man.
We follow the Google Python Style Guide and the Napoleon Sphinx extension to parse Google style docstring.
