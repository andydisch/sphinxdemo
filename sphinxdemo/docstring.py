"""Example Google style module docstrings.

This module demonstrates documentation as specified by the `Google Python
Style Guide`_. Docstrings may extend over multiple lines. Sections are created
with a section header and a colon followed by a block of indented text.

Example:
    Examples can be given using either the ``Example`` or ``Examples``
    sections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
    literal blocks::

        $ python run_script.py

Section breaks are created by resuming unindented text. Section breaks
are also implicitly created anytime a new section starts.

Todo:
    * For module TODOs
    * You have to also use ``sphinx.ext.todo`` extension
